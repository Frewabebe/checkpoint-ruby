end
def initialize(initial_name, initialize_greet)
  @name = initial_name
  @grit = initialize_greet
end



# Question 7
# Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba".
# Type your solution directly below this line:
def animal(name)
  puts "pumba"
end

# Each lion should have the same attributes and methods as `Animal`. Each lion
# should also have...
# - A `king` (Boolean) attribute
# - Only set the `king` attribute to `true` if the instance's `name` is "Simba"
# Type your solution directly below this line:
